# Add Multi-File

Create custom multi-file items in VS Code, with variable name support!

## Configuration

1. Define the templates in your [`settings.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) file. All templates need a name and their corresponding items, together with an optional description.

Variables are supported using `$` followed by a number (so all occurrences of `$N` will be replaced by the `N`th argument you provide during item creation).

```json
"addmultifile.templates": [
    {
        "name": "React Component",
        "description": "Item for a React component and its styles",
        "items": ["$0/$0.tsx", "$0/$0.styled.ts"]
    },
    {
        "name": "Test suite",
        "description": "Item for a unit test",
        "items": ["test-$0/$1.ts", "test-$0/$1.test.ts"]
    }
]
```

2. To create a new multi-file item, right click on the respective folder (just as you would for creating a new file or folder) and select "New Multi-File Item...":

3. Select the item you want to create.

4. If applicable, input the template's arguments, separated by spaces.

5. Done! Your custom multi-file item should be created :)
